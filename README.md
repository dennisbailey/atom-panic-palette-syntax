# atom-panic-palette-syntax
This is the Panic Palette syntax highlighting ported to the Atom Text editor. This code base has been copied from [this repo](https://github.com/rodrigoteobaldo/panic-palette-syntax) which seems to have been abandoned. I will try to keep this repo working with the latest Atom releases, but all credit goes to [rodrigoteobaldo](https://github.com/rodrigoteobaldo/)!
